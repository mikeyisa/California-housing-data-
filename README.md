# California Median Housing Prices Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict the median housing prices in California using various data science and machine learning techniques. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset containing information about different housing attributes and their geographic locations, this project seeks to provide valuable insights into the factors affecting housing prices and develop a robust predictive model.

## Objectives

1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset through visualizations and descriptive statistics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that can enhance the predictive power of the model.
4. **Model Development**: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to identify the best performing model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to evaluate and compare model performance.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model's hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to improve its accuracy.
7. **Final Model Evaluation**: Assess the final model's performance on a test set and compute confidence intervals for the evaluation metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the California Housing Prices dataset, which includes the following attributes:

- **Longitude**: The longitude of the location.
- **Latitude**: The latitude of the location.
- **Housing Median Age**: The median age of the houses.
- **Total Rooms**: The total number of rooms in all houses.
- **Total Bedrooms**: The total number of bedrooms in all houses.
- **Population**: The population of the district.
- **Households**: The number of households in the district.
- **Median Income**: The median income of the households.
- **Median House Value**: The median value of the houses.
- **Ocean Proximity**: The proximity of the district to the ocean.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis and model development.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
